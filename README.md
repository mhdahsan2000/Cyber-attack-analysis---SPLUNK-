Cyber-attack-analysis using SPLUNK and PCAP Analyser


In this project I have used SPLUNK to analyse the given PCAP dataset to detect Cyber attacks including other threats and provide possible solutions.

Cyber-attack detection in Network traffic data and it’s feasible countermeasures


Project Abstract

In today’s world Internet have become ubiquitous and the number of users is on the rise on day-to-day basis. With the rise in user data and network usage <br> there exists a greater responsibility to protect the network from cyber threats including malware attacks where the user data would be accessed and manipulated by unauthorized users involving hackers. <br>

With very valuable data being stolen can result in greater damage to the many different organisations and user groups. As a result, it’s very crucial that user data is well protected and there would exist a secure channel for communication to take place. In such a circumstance, quite often Splunk can be a very powerful analytic tool that can help detect and evade these cyber security threats and attacks. The very purpose of this project was to analyse and evaluate the network traffic using Splunk as a tool for the given dataset and to assess the many different consequences and countermeasures that can be deployed in the real world for cyber threats and attacks. Feasible countermeasures were investigated and deployed through Splunk which was very effective to identify and evade many security vulnerabilities.


Keywords — Cyber-threat detection; Splunk; Malware Analysis; Network Traffic evaluation; threat evasion.
